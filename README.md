# TamaPet

## Overview

TamaPet is an Android game that I developed in one week. From (March 11th to March 18th), with minor bug or asthetic fixes after that.

I am new at this and started to teach my self Android Development on March 11th. 

TamaPet is like a Tamagotchi game. You get a randomly generated pet that you try to keep alive. They don't evolve but you have a chance of getting a different pet each time. As time goes on I will continue to add more pets. My goal is at least 50.

## What you can do

Here is a list of what you can do with your pet

- Feed - This will update your Hunger meter (If sound is on it makes an eating sound)
- Water - This will update your Water meter (If sound is on it makes a drinking sound)
- Treat - This will update your Happy and Hunger but will decrement your Health meter.
- Punish - This will decrement your Happy metter but will also decrement the chance of your creature acting out.
- Shot - When your pet's health is very low you can use this but it will also severely lower their happiness.
- Play
  - Game 1 - is a guessing game. Guess a number between 0 and 4 with 3 chances. If you win your pet's happiness will go up.
  - Game 2 - is a hangman game. You have about a hundred words that will be chosen at random. If you win your pet's happiness will go up.
- Ball - This is a toy and if you bring it out (or put it away and bring it out) Happy will go up
- Feather - This is a toy and if you bring it out (or put it away and bring it out) Happy will go up
- Touch your pet - This will cause your pet to get more Happy. (If sound is on it purrs)
- Touch the screen - your pet will go to where you touch

## Random Events

There will be random events that happen everytime you click on a button if your pet is loaded. 

These events have a negative or positive affect on your pet.

If you punish your pet the chance for these events go down. (But be aware you also lose positive events as well as the negative)

## Save

When you create your pet it saves it to a file. You can also delete pets. You can make as many pets that will fit on a screen...
